#Yield is a keyword that is used like return, except the function will return a generator.

"""
When you call a normal function with a return statement the function is terminated
whenever it encounters a return statement. In a function with a yield statement the state of the
function is “saved” from the last call and can be picked up the next time you call a generator function.
