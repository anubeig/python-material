"""
Python supports a concept called "list comprehensions".
It can be used to construct lists in a very natural, easy way, like a mathematician is used to do.
It consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then
zero or more for or if clauses. The expressions can be anything, meaning you can
put in all kinds of objects in lists.

The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the
context of the for and if clauses which follow it.

The list comprehension always returns a result list.


Syntax :- [ expression for item in list if conditional ]
