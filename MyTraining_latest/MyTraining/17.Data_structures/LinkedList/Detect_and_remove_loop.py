# Python program to detect and remove loop

"""
. After detecting the loop,
if we start slow pointer from head and move both slow and fast pointers at same speed until fast donâ€™t meet,
they would meet at the beginning of linked list.

So if we start moving both pointers again at same speed such that one pointer (say slow) begins from head node of linked list and
other pointer (say fast) begins from meeting point.
 When slow pointer reaches beginning of linked list (has made m steps).
  Fast pointer would have made also moved m steps as they are now moving same pace. Since m+k is a multiple of n and fast starts from k,
they would meet at the beginning.
Can they meet before also? No because slow pointer enters the cycle first time after m steps.
