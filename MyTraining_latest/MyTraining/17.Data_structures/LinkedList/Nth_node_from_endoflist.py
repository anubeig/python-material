Method 2 (Use two pointers)
Maintain two pointers â€“ reference pointer and main pointer.
Initialize both reference and main pointers to head.
First move reference pointer to n nodes from head.
Now move both pointers one by one until reference pointer reaches end.
Now main pointer will point to nth node from the end. Return main pointer.
