1.Basic questions on oops:
  *.Implement Base class using Instance, static and Abstract method
    instance method - takes two arguments to add operation
    static method - takes two args to multiply operation
    abstract method - takes two args to div operation
  *. Implement child class using 3 instance methods
    instance - takes three args for add operation
    instance - takes two args for multiplicatio operation
    instance - takes two args for div opration

    create a relation between two classes
2. How you realate two objects in python? For example Book and Page.
3. find the sum of sequence by skipping the between elements without using slicing.
    Ex seq = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] where x = 4, y = 7
       skip elements between x and y(including x and y i,e. [4, 5, 6, 7]) always y
       comes after x
       output: 1+2+3+8+9 = 23
4. File question:
   File has following data:
   Print the words of the file by sorting order of the corresponding integers.
   Expected output:
    ABC, IJK, PQR, TUV, DEF
   =======
   TUV
   7
   PQR
   4
   ABC
   1
   DEF
   8
   IJK
   3
   =========
5. What is decorator? use of decorator? How you implement the decrator for argumented functions to override the behaviour.
6. Difference between __new__ and __init__ ??
